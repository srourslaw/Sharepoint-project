## üîß MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED TODAY

### 1. **PEOPLE & SHARING PAGE - COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION**
**Problem:** Page showed fake team members (Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen, Emily Davis) instead of real organization data

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Completely rewrote** `/api/sharepoint-advanced/me/people` endpoint
- **Intelligent real people extraction** from SharePoint file activities
- **Scans actual SharePoint sites** to find file creators/editors
- **Extracts real names and emails** from file metadata
- **Eliminated all mock data fallbacks**

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/routes/sharepoint-advanced.ts` (lines 534-648)
- `client/src/hooks/useSharePointPeople.ts` (lines 115-158)

**Result:** Team Members tab now shows ONLY real people from Hussein's organization

### 2. **DOCKER CONTAINER NETWORKING ISSUES**
**Problem:** Frontend container couldn't reach backend, causing nginx "page unavailable" errors

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Fixed TypeScript compilation errors** preventing container builds
- **Complete Docker rebuild** with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build -d`
- **Restored networking** between frontend and backend containers

### 3. **THAKRAL ONE BRANDING INTEGRATION**
**Problem:** Corporate branding not visible on dashboard

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Applied professional branding** to `Dashboard.debug.tsx` (correct component)
- **Added Thakral One logo** and company colors
- **Implemented fixed footer** with corporate information
- **Microsoft theme colors** (blue/purple gradient)
