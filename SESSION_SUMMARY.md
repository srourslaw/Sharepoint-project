## üîß MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED TODAY

### 1. **ALL COMPANY FOLDER 404 ERROR - COMPLETE FIX**
**Problem:** All Company folder was throwing 404 errors when users tried to access it from the dashboard

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Frontend was using wrong SharePoint driveId endpoint
- All Company folder was using same endpoint as Communication site 
- Backend expects specific subsite format: `netorgft18344752.sharepoint.com:sites:allcompany`
- Frontend was sending: `netorgft18344752.sharepoint.com` (missing subsite part)

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Root cause:** Microsoft Graph API rejected the subsite URL format `/sites/host:/sites/subsite:/drives`
- **New approach:** Use site ID resolution instead of direct subsite URL
- **Frontend:** Changed driveId to `site-allcompany` (cleaner identifier)
- **Backend:** Added proper site resolution logic (get site ‚Üí get drives ‚Üí use drive ID)
- **Preserved Communication site functionality** (no changes to working endpoint)

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/hooks/useSharePointFiles.ts` (line 128 - changed to `site-allcompany`)
- `server/src/routes/sharepoint-advanced.ts` (lines 1044, 1461 - added site resolution logic)

**Technical Fix:**
1. Frontend sends `site-allcompany` as driveId
2. Backend recognizes this and calls `/sites/netorgft18344752.sharepoint.com:/sites/allcompany` to get site details
3. Gets actual site.id from response
4. Calls `/sites/{site.id}/drives` to get available drives  
5. Uses first drive (default document library) to access files with `/drives/{drive.id}/root/children`

**Result:** All Company folder now works with proper Microsoft Graph API compliance

### 2. **PREVIOUS SESSION: PEOPLE & SHARING PAGE - COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION**
**Problem:** Page showed fake team members (Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen, Emily Davis) instead of real organization data

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Completely rewrote** `/api/sharepoint-advanced/me/people` endpoint
- **Intelligent real people extraction** from SharePoint file activities
- **Scans actual SharePoint sites** to find file creators/editors
- **Extracts real names and emails** from file metadata
- **Eliminated all mock data fallbacks**

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/routes/sharepoint-advanced.ts` (lines 534-648)
- `client/src/hooks/useSharePointPeople.ts` (lines 115-158)

**Result:** Team Members tab now shows ONLY real people from Hussein's organization

### 2. **DOCKER CONTAINER NETWORKING ISSUES**
**Problem:** Frontend container couldn't reach backend, causing nginx "page unavailable" errors

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Fixed TypeScript compilation errors** preventing container builds
- **Complete Docker rebuild** with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build -d`
- **Restored networking** between frontend and backend containers

### 3. **THAKRAL ONE BRANDING INTEGRATION**
**Problem:** Corporate branding not visible on dashboard

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Applied professional branding** to `Dashboard.debug.tsx` (correct component)
- **Added Thakral One logo** and company colors
- **Implemented fixed footer** with corporate information
- **Microsoft theme colors** (blue/purple gradient)
