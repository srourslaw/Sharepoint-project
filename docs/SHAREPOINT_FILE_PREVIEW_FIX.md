# SharePoint File Content Preview Fix - Complete Technical Documentation

**Fix Date**: September 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Critical file preview functionality restored
**Impact**: File previews now work for PDFs, Word docs, Excel files, and images from all organizational SharePoint sites

---

## 🚨 **Problem Summary**

### **User-Reported Issue**
Users could browse SharePoint files successfully but file content preview was failing with "FILE_CONTENT_NOT_FOUND" errors. This affected:
- ✅ **Working**: File listing and navigation (All Company, Testing site, Communication site, etc.)
- ❌ **Broken**: File content preview (clicking on files to view content)
- ❌ **Impact**: Users saw placeholder/mock content instead of real SharePoint files

### **Technical Symptoms**
```bash
❌ Graph API error getting file preview: Error: File with ID 01I5MJI3WFXQZWCGZLYVGINZC6UCB62C5W not found in any accessible drive
🔄 Falling back to mock data due to SharePoint error
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Critical Discovery**
Through systematic debugging, we discovered that file content requests were using a **different API endpoint** than file listing:

- **File Listing (Working)**: `/api/sharepoint-advanced/drives/root/items/root/children`
  - Uses comprehensive organizational site discovery via `/sites?search=*`
  - Finds 6 organizational sites successfully

- **File Preview (Broken)**: `/api/sharepoint-advanced/files/:fileId/preview`
  - Was only using `/me/drives` (user drives only)
  - Found 0 organizational sites, causing preview failures

### **Architectural Mismatch**
```typescript
// WORKING FILE LISTING APPROACH
const sitesResponse = await graphClient.api('/sites?search=*').get();
// Result: ✅ Found 6 organizational sites

// BROKEN PREVIEW APPROACH (BEFORE FIX)
const drivesResponse = await graphClient.api('/me/drives').get();
// Result: ❌ Found 0 organizational sites, only 2 personal drives
```

## 🛠 **Technical Solution**

### **Fix Strategy**
Apply the **exact same organizational site discovery pattern** from working file listing to the broken preview endpoint.

### **Code Changes Made**

#### **File Modified**: `server/src/routes/sharepoint-advanced.ts`

**Location**: Line 3257 - Preview endpoint (`router.get('/files/:fileId/preview')`)

#### **Before Fix** (Lines 3276-3285):
```typescript
// Search for file across all user drives to get correct drive/site context
console.log('🔍 Searching all accessible drives for file...');
const drivesResponse = await graphClient.api('/me/drives').select('id,name,description,webUrl,createdDateTime,lastModifiedDateTime,driveType,quota').get();
console.log(`Found ${drivesResponse.value?.length || 0} drives to search`);

// Prioritize business drives over personal drives
const allDrives = drivesResponse.value || [];
const businessDrives = allDrives.filter(isBusinessDrive);
const personalDrives = allDrives.filter((drive: any) => !isBusinessDrive(drive));
const searchOrder = [...businessDrives, ...personalDrives];
```

#### **After Fix** (Lines 3276-3325):
```typescript
// Search for file across organizational sites + user drives (same as working file listing)
console.log('🔍 Searching all accessible drives for file...');

// Step 1: Get user drives
const drivesResponse = await graphClient.api('/me/drives').select('id,name,description,webUrl,createdDateTime,lastModifiedDateTime,driveType,quota').get();
console.log(`Found ${drivesResponse.value?.length || 0} user drives to search`);

// Step 2: Get organizational site drives (same as working file listing approach)
console.log('🔍 Getting organizational sites for file preview...');
const orgSiteDrives: any[] = [];
try {
  // Use the EXACT same API call that works in file listing
  const sitesResponse = await graphClient.api('/sites?search=*').get();
  console.log(`✅ Found ${sitesResponse.value?.length || 0} organizational sites for preview`);

  for (const site of sitesResponse.value || []) {
    if (isBusinessSite(site)) {
      try {
        const siteId = site.id;
        // Use the same approach as working file listing: get site drives and find Documents library
        const siteDrivesResponse = await graphClient.api(`/sites/${siteId}/drives`).select('id,name,description,webUrl,createdDateTime,lastModifiedDateTime,driveType,quota').get();
        const defaultDrive = siteDrivesResponse.value?.find((drive: any) =>
          drive.name === 'Documents' || drive.driveType === 'documentLibrary'
        );

        if (defaultDrive) {
          defaultDrive.siteName = site.displayName;
          defaultDrive.siteUrl = site.webUrl;
          defaultDrive.siteId = siteId;
          orgSiteDrives.push(defaultDrive);
          console.log(`✅ Added site drive for preview: ${defaultDrive.name} from ${site.displayName}`);
        } else {
          console.log(`⚠️ No default drive found in site ${site.displayName}`);
        }
      } catch (siteDriveError: any) {
        console.log(`⚠️ Could not get drives for site ${site.displayName}:`, siteDriveError.message);
      }
    }
  }
} catch (sitesError: any) {
  console.log('⚠️ Could not get organizational sites for preview:', sitesError.message);
}

// Combine all drives: organizational sites + user drives (prioritize site drives)
const allUserDrives = drivesResponse.value || [];
const userBusinessDrives = allUserDrives.filter(isBusinessDrive);
const personalDrives = allUserDrives.filter((drive: any) => !isBusinessDrive(drive));
const searchOrder = [...orgSiteDrives, ...userBusinessDrives, ...personalDrives];

console.log(`🔍 Preview search order: ${orgSiteDrives.length} site drives + ${userBusinessDrives.length} user business drives + ${personalDrives.length} personal drives = ${searchOrder.length} total`);
```

#### **Enhanced Search Loop** (Lines 3330-3346):
```typescript
for (const drive of searchOrder) {
  try {
    const driveLabel = drive.siteName ? `${drive.name} in site "${drive.siteName}"` : drive.name;
    console.log(`🔍 Searching drive for preview: ${driveLabel} (${drive.driveType})`);
    fileMetadata = await graphClient.api(`/drives/${drive.id}/items/${fileId}`).get();
    driveContext = drive;
    console.log(`📄 Found file for preview in drive ${driveLabel}:`, {
      name: fileMetadata.name,
      mimeType: fileMetadata.file?.mimeType,
      webUrl: fileMetadata.webUrl
    });
    break;
  } catch (driveError: any) {
    const driveLabel = drive.siteName ? `${drive.name} in site "${drive.siteName}"` : drive.name;
    console.log(`🔍 File not found in drive ${driveLabel}:`, driveError.message || 'Unknown error');
  }
}
```

## 📊 **Results & Verification**

### **Before Fix (Failing)**
```bash
Found 2 drives to search
🚫 Filtering out personal drive: PersonalCacheLibrary
🚫 Filtering out personal drive: OneDrive
❌ Graph API error getting file preview: Error: File with ID [...] not found in any accessible drive
```

### **After Fix (Working)**
```bash
🔍 Getting organizational sites for file preview...
✅ Found 6 organizational sites for preview
✅ Added site drive for preview: Documents from Testing site
✅ Added site drive for preview: Documents from All Company
✅ Added site drive for preview: Documents from Testing-APP
✅ Added site drive for preview: Documents from Communication site
✅ Added site drive for preview: Documents from Group for Answers in Viva Engage
✅ Added site drive for preview: Documents from Team Site
🔍 Preview search order: 6 site drives + 0 user business drives + 2 personal drives = 8 total
📄 Found file for preview in drive Documents in site "All Company": BH worldwide.docx
✅ Microsoft Graph preview URL obtained
```

### **File Types Successfully Fixed**
- ✅ **PDF files**: Native preview working
- ✅ **Word documents (.docx, .doc)**: Microsoft Graph preview URLs working
- ✅ **Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)**: Microsoft Graph preview URLs working
- ✅ **Images (.jpg, .png, etc.)**: Blob URL preview working
- ✅ **Screenshots**: Image preview working

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Key Components Fixed**

1. **Organizational Site Discovery**
   - Uses `/sites?search=*` API call (same as working file listing)
   - Discovers all accessible organizational SharePoint sites
   - Filters for business sites using `isBusinessSite()` function

2. **Drive Enumeration**
   - Gets document libraries from each organizational site
   - Finds default "Documents" drives for each site
   - Maintains site context (name, URL, ID) for better logging

3. **Search Prioritization**
   - **Priority 1**: Organizational site drives (6 drives found)
   - **Priority 2**: User business drives (0 found in this case)
   - **Priority 3**: Personal drives (2 found)

4. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Clear visibility into organizational site discovery process
   - Detailed drive search progress with site context
   - Success/failure tracking for each step

### **Microsoft Graph API Endpoints Used**
```typescript
// Site discovery (same as working file listing)
await graphClient.api('/sites?search=*').get()

// Site drives enumeration
await graphClient.api(`/sites/${siteId}/drives`).get()

// File metadata retrieval
await graphClient.api(`/drives/${drive.id}/items/${fileId}`).get()

// Microsoft Graph preview URL generation
await graphClient.api(`/drives/${driveContext.id}/items/${fileId}/preview`).post({})
```

## 💡 **Lessons Learned**

### **Key Insights**
1. **Same API, Different Endpoints**: File listing and file preview used different logic despite serving related functionality
2. **Comprehensive Site Discovery Essential**: `/me/drives` alone is insufficient for organizational SharePoint access
3. **Debugging Strategy**: Systematic log analysis and endpoint tracing was crucial for identifying the root cause
4. **Pattern Replication**: Copying successful patterns between related endpoints ensures consistency

### **Architecture Improvements**
1. **Unified Site Discovery**: Both file listing and preview now use identical organizational site discovery
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive debug output for troubleshooting future issues
3. **Prioritized Search**: Organizational sites searched before personal drives for better performance
4. **Site Context Preservation**: Maintains site information for better user experience and debugging
